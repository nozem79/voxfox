## 2.0.6

- Piper now stays loaded between sentences. Previously the voice model was
  loaded from disk on every utterance, causing a half-second to one-second
  delay before the first word. Now Piper runs as a persistent background
  process; the model is loaded once (on the first call, or when you switch
  voice/speed/pitch) and all subsequent calls answer in synthesis time only
  (~100 ms). The first sentence of a new utterance is also faster because
  of the prefetch pipeline added in 2.0.5.
